2. Or: Xcode → Settings → Accounts → Download Manual Profiles

---

## 5. CI/CD Secrets Setup

For automated deployment via GitHub Actions, you need to set up secrets.

### Step 5.1: Create App Store Connect API Key

1. Go to [appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api)
2. Click **Keys** tab → **+** (Generate API Key)
3. Name: `Sashimi CI`
4. Access: **App Manager**
5. Click **Generate**
6. **Download the .p8 file immediately** (you can only download it once!)
7. Note the **Key ID** and **Issuer ID** shown on the page

### Step 5.2: Set Up Match (Certificate Storage)

Match stores your certificates in a private Git repository. This is the recommended approach.

1. Create a **private** GitHub repository for certificates:
   - Example: `github.com/mondominator/certificates` (private!)

2. Initialize Match:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/sashimi
   bundle exec fastlane match init
   ```
   - Select **git**
   - Enter your certificates repo URL

3. Generate certificates:
   ```bash
   bundle exec fastlane match appstore
   ```
   - This creates distribution certificates and profiles
   - You'll be prompted for a password - **save this password!**

### Step 5.3: Add GitHub Secrets

Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**

Add these secrets:

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID` | Your API Key ID (from Step 5.1) |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID` | Your Issuer ID (from Step 5.1) |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_CONTENT` | Base64-encoded .p8 file content* |
| `MATCH_PASSWORD` | Password you set for Match |
| `MATCH_GIT_URL` | `git@github.com:mondominator/certificates.git` |

*To base64 encode the .p8 file:
```bash
base64 -i AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 | pbcopy
```

### Step 5.4: Add Deploy Key for Match Repo

1. Generate SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions" -f deploy_key
   ```

2. Add **public key** as Deploy Key to certificates repo:
   - Go to certificates repo → Settings → Deploy Keys → Add
   - Paste contents of `deploy_key.pub`
   - Enable **Allow write access**

3. Add **private key** as secret to Sashimi repo:
   - Secret name: `MATCH_DEPLOY_KEY`
   - Value: Contents of `deploy_key`

## 6. Local Development Deployment

### Deploy to TestFlight Manually

```bash
cd /path/to/sashimi

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Generate Xcode project
xcodegen generate

# Deploy to TestFlight
bundle exec fastlane beta
```

### Deploy to App Store Manually

```bash
bundle exec fastlane release
```

---

## 7. CI/CD Automated Deployment

### TestFlight (Beta) Deployment

Automatic on beta tags:
```bash
# Bump version and create beta tag
./scripts/bump-version.sh patch
git add -A && git commit -m "chore: bump version"
git tag v1.0.1-beta.1
git push && git push --tags
```

### Manual Deployment via GitHub Actions

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select **Deploy** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Choose environment: `testflight` or `appstore`
5. Click **Run workflow**

---

## 8. App Store Submission

### Step 8.1: Upload Build

After running `fastlane release` or the CI workflow, your build uploads to App Store Connect.

### Step 8.2: Add Screenshots

1. In App Store Connect, go to your app → **App Store** tab
2. Scroll to **tvOS Screenshots**
3. Upload screenshots:
   - **Apple TV**: 1920×1080 or 3840×2160
4. Add at least 1 screenshot

### Step 8.3: Submit for Review

1. Fill in all required metadata
2. Select your uploaded build
3. Click **Submit for Review**

### What to Expect

- **Review time**: Usually 24-48 hours, sometimes up to a week
- **Rejection reasons**: Often minor issues, fixable
- **Common rejections**:
  - Missing demo account
  - Bugs found during review
  - Guideline violations

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

### "No matching provisioning profiles found"

```bash
# Regenerate profiles
bundle exec fastlane match appstore --force
```

### "The bundle identifier does not match"

- Ensure Bundle ID in App Store Connect matches `com.sashimi.app`
- Check `project.yml` has correct `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`

### "Invalid binary"

- Make sure you're building for tvOS, not iOS
- Check deployment target is tvOS 17.0+

### CI Workflow Fails

1. Check **Actions** logs for specific error
2. Verify all secrets are set correctly
3. Ensure certificates haven't expired

### Match Password Lost

If you lose the Match password:
1. Delete all certs from certificates repo
2. Revoke certificates in Apple Developer Portal
3. Run `bundle exec fastlane match appstore` again with new password
