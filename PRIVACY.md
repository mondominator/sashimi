# Privacy Policy for Sashimi

**Last updated: January 2025**

## Overview

Sashimi is a tvOS client for Jellyfin media servers. This privacy policy explains how Sashimi handles your data.

## Data Collection

**Sashimi does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to us or any third parties.**

### What Sashimi Stores Locally

Sashimi stores the following data locally on your Apple TV device:

1. **Server Connection Details**
   - Your Jellyfin server URL
   - Authentication tokens (stored securely in iOS Keychain)

2. **User Preferences**
   - Home screen customization settings
   - Video quality preferences

3. **Playback State**
   - Current playback position (synced with your Jellyfin server)

### Data Transmission

Sashimi only communicates with:

1. **Your Jellyfin Server** - All media browsing, streaming, and playback progress is sent directly to your own Jellyfin server. This communication is between your Apple TV and your server only.

2. **No Third-Party Services** - Sashimi does not use any analytics, tracking, crash reporting, or advertising services.

## Data Storage Security

- Authentication tokens are stored in the iOS Keychain using industry-standard encryption
- No sensitive data is stored in plain text
- Data is stored only on your device and your Jellyfin server

## Your Jellyfin Server

Your Jellyfin server has its own privacy practices. Sashimi does not control what data your Jellyfin server collects or stores. Please refer to the Jellyfin documentation and your server administrator for information about server-side data handling.

## Children's Privacy

Sashimi does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app requires access to a Jellyfin server, which is typically set up by adults.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted to this page and the app's App Store listing.
